 Welcome to the dwarf village! How may I help you today
 Hello, we are travelers seeking information about a hidden treasure. We've heard that there are dwarves here who can help us
 Ah, the dwarves' treasure! Yes, we've heard much about it. But it's a well-guarded secret. Why do you seek the treasure
 We are looking for the treasure to return it to its original place and stop a wicked wizard who is searching for it to become more powerful
 That's a noble cause! But the road to the treasure is not easy. There are many dangers along the way
 We understand the risks, but we are willing to do whatever is necessary to stop the wizard. Can you help us find the road to the treasure
 Yes, I will. But first, you must do one thing for me. There is a dragon that is attacking the village and causing problems. If you kill it, I will give you all the information you need about the road to the treasure
 Understood, we will set out to kill the dragon. Thank you for your help
 Good luck on your adventure! May the gods protect you.
